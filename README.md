# Clipboard Landing Page Website

## Project Overview

This is a project I took from Frontend Mentor to enhance my knowledge of Tailwind CSS. The website is a simple landing page for a clipboard management application. It's a mock website designed to demonstrate the application's features in a visually appealing way. The main focus is on practicing layout design and responsive UI with Tailwind CSS.

### Features Implemented So Far:
- **Hero Section**:
  - Designed and implemented the hero section of the landing page, which features a clean and simple layout.
  - The section includes a background image, heading text, along with call-to-action (CTA) buttons.
  - Built using Tailwind CSS to create a flexible, responsive design that adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes.

- **Product Overview Section**:
  - The section includes the descriptive workings of the Clipboard app.
  - It also features the use of flexbox for layout of certain components in the section.

- **Clients Section**
  - This section uses flexbox to make the layout responsive.

- **CTA Section**: 
  - This section is a replica of the hero section but with small font sizes.

### Tools & Technologies:
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for styling and layout with a focus on utility-first CSS, making the design both responsive and easily customizable.
- **HTML**: Structured the page with semantic HTML for better accessibility and SEO performance.
- **No JavaScript Yet**: Currently, there is no JavaScript implemented. The focus is on the design and layout using Tailwind CSS.

### Repository Contents:
- **Assets Folder**: Contains images, icons, and other resources used in the design.
- **Figma Designs**: Includes the Figma design file that outlines the visual direction for the landing page. This helps ensure the design is in line with the intended aesthetic and functionality.

## Next Steps:
- Enhance the responsiveness to handle more breakpoints.
- Implement JavaScript for additional interactivity once the core design is complete.

## Why Tailwind CSS?
I chose to use Tailwind CSS in this project because it allows for rapid development of responsive and customizable designs. Its utility-first approach helps keep the code clean and manageable while enabling precise control over layout and styling.
